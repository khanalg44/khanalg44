  * Introduction and real applications of Density Functioal Theory (DFT) and embedded Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (eDMFT) calculations on solids.
  * Python TightBinding models for various Topological phases of real materials.
  
* Introduction to **python programming language for physics research** as well as data science.
* Introduction to **Linux and bash scripting language**
  * Everything from **grep, egrep, sed, awk** to **vi editor**
* Machine learning and deep learning. 
  * Implementation of various ML algorithms from scratch (only using numpy)
  * Real world application of various ML methods on different data sets.
* Natural language processing:

* Quantum computing algorithms and quantum machine learning
  * Intruction to basic quantum computing algorithms from basic quantum mechanics to python implementation using **qiskit** developed by IBM.
  * Introduction to some Quantum Machine Learning algorithms.
  * Check here for code: https://github.com/quantumyatra/

* Writing web application code and deploying Machine learning models
  * Develope beginer webapp using Flask and Streamlit
  * Deploy your model on Herokuapp.

# My Top Datascience Projects

### **Gristock**: Predicting Viral Posts on Reddit
 * **Finalist of the Erdos Data Science Bootcamp 2021.**
 * Scraped >2M Reddit posts from Reddit and >72K unique tweets mentioning GameStop.
 * Wrangled the features to extract intrinsic properties of the posts along with external information.
 * Built predictive models using word vectorization and probability calibration on an imbalanced (5:95) dataset.
 * Deployed the model via Heroku with the option to choose between aggressive (high recall) and defensive (high precision) strategies.
 * Website: (https://gristock.herokuapp.com/)

### **ToxCom**: Identify Toxic Online Comments
 * Project work for NLP-Pilot Bootcamp organized by Erdos Institute.
 * Processed the highly imbalanced data set containing Wikipedia comments posted online.
 * Used Logistic Regression, Random Forrest, XGBoost, and various Neural Network architecture for the multilabel multiclass classification problem.
 * Developed a web app and deployed it online (https://toxcom.herokuapp.com/) for any user to find whether an online comment is toxic or not as well as to distinguish what kind of toxic label the comment has.

### **MagNet**: Forecast Geomagnetic Storms, Drivendata.org 
* Cleaned the real-time solar wind data and imputed it using forward fill and interpolation methods to predict DST index.
* Performed time-series analysis using ARIMA model as well as implemented LSTM model in TensorFlow-2 framework.
* Ranked within the top 8% (group of four) among more than 600 participants in the competition for the LSTM implementation
* Find Code here [github.com/khanalg44/MagNet](github.com/khanalg44/MagNet).
