## Ghanashyam Khanal's Personal Repository

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ... Welcome to my personal git repo. I hope you'll learn at least something here. You can find my codes in various different categories including the following:

* Research on **computational condensed matter physics**. Check my webstite https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~khanal/
* Introduction to **python programming language for physics research** as well as data science.
* Introduction to **Linux and bash scripting language**
* **Machine learning and deep learning.** from implementation from scratch to implementing using various packages.
* **Natural language processing:** https://github.com/khanalg44/nlp_projects/
* **Quantum computing algorithms** and **quantum machine learning**. Check [QuantumYatra](https://github.com/quantumyatra/).
